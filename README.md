# Silbo Gomero ASR

This repository is released as supplementary material to the paper "Whistle-to-text: Automatic recognition of the Silbo Gomero whistled language".
It contains scripts and settings used by me to train the ASR models described in the paper, as well as an annotated corpus of Silbo Gomero.
